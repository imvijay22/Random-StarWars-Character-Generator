# Random-StarWars-Character-Generator
Built with jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5. This webpage randomly selects a Star Wars character and fetches their information using the https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/ API. After pressing the button GENERATE, the results are shown on the webpage, as well as the status of the Ajax request. There are a total of 88 characters present in the API, so each time the GENERATE button is clicked a random character out of the 88 is displayed.
The project is similar to the Radnom_Star_Wars_Character_Webpage but the communication with the API is done using jQuery in order to show the advantage of using the library.
